                </ul>
                <p>This course is created with the same curriculum as our 12-week in-person programming Bootcamp.</p>
                <p>This means you can look forward to the same professional-level content covering every aspect of web development, from HTML to React.</p>
                <p>This is the only course you need to become a professional, full-stack web developer.</p>
                <p>The best part is that the course is completely project-based, so you will learn everything you need to know while building beautiful real-world websites and web applications.</p>
                <p>You will build a beautiful product website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.</p>
                <p>You will build games and musical apps like a drum kit.</p>
                <p>You will learn about Node, React, and the MERN stack to build classic developer projects such as a to-do list app and a project manager that is perfect for showcasing at your next interview.</p>
                <p>This course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.</p>
                <p>If you are a complete beginner, I will be there every step of the way, taking you from programming fundamentals all the way through to intermediate and more advanced concepts.</p>
                <p>Instead of spending $12,000 on our in-person Bootcamp and having to take time off work, you will get access to exactly the same curriculum that has years of design and testing behind it.</p>
                <p>You will not only know what to do, but also why you are doing it.</p>
                <p>Your time is precious, and that is why you deserve the best course money can buy.</p>
